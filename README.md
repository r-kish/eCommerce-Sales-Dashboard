# e-Commerce Sales Dashboard (2023 Yearly Report)

The e-Commerce industry was first popularized by eBay in 1995, with its introduction to online auctioning. Ever since then, e-Commerce has seen many new platforms such as Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, and Etsy just to name some of the currently popular ones. 

This project was intended to reflect the sales statistics into a yearly report dashboard for an online seller that uses multiple platforms for their business.

Data for this project was extracted from the sales report generators for eBay, Poshmark, and Mercari. Date range is from Jan 1, 2023 - Dec 31, 2023. Datasets were cleaned in Excel, and transferred to Tableau for visualization and dashboard creation.
